=head1 NAME

todoist - command-line tool for managing your todoist.com todo list

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 todoist -project perl -token XXX -i taskfile.txt [ -priority 1|2|3|4 ]
         [ -add-project projectname ]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script gives you a command-line interface to the API for todoist,
which is an online todo list service, with interfaces on most mobile
devices and desktop operating systems.

At the moment this just supports two operations:

=over 4

=item * importing a list of tasks from a text file, with one task per line.

=item * adding a new project

=back

It will evolve over time - I'll be adding more features as I need them.
I've released this in a separate dist so as not to add a bunch of
non-core dependencies to L<Net::Todoist>.

You can create a C<.todoist> file in your home directory,
with default values for the various parameters.
This is probably where you want to provide your API token:

 token    = XXXXXX
 priority = 4
 project  = work

Note that this file must only be readable by you.
